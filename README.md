This hackathon has taught us a lot, everything from the basics of python to learning how to create a website. We’ve put in all our creative minds and created a truly amazing product. Some skills we’ve learned are how to run Jupyter Notebook, WebApp development, principles of marketing, and most of all we’ve learned how to create an online product as a team. This has been an amazing experience for all of us in the team and we would love to do it again. Hope you enjoyed our presentation and product.
